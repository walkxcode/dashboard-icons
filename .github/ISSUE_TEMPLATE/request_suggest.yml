      value: "Thank you for your interest in contributing to our icon repository! To ensure that everything runs smoothly, we've set out some guidelines for contributors.\n## 🌟 Icon Specifications\n\n- Each icon should include both a **PNG** and **SVG** version. If an **SVG** cannot be found, then only a **PNG** version is required.\n\n- Each icon should be in **PNG** format and have a height of exactly **512px**. Width does not matter. ❗️(No upscales! If the correct size cannot be found, a smaller height will be accepted.)\n\n- Icons should be named after their full name, using the [Kebab Case](https://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase) naming convention. For example, \"Facebook Messenger\" should be named `facebook-messenger.png`.\n\n- Monochrome icons should default to a dark version. Light versions should be named `service-light.png`. If a light version is not available, use [https://pinetools.com/colorize-image](https://pinetools.com/colorize-image) to change its color.\n"
